//    A Day Without Coding
//    This morning, I went out with Mr. Du until the afternoon.
//    Then, the club held a recruitment and ice-breaking session that lasted until 9:30 PM.
//    After taking a shower when I got back,
//    I washed the clothes I'd piled up over the past few days,
//    and I've been doing laundry until now.
//    I was so busy today that I had no time to code,
//    so I'm asking for a one-day leave.
